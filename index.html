        </h2>

        <p id="pwelcome">
          Dear colleagues, dear aviators, dear friends:<br><br>
          On behalf of the Spanish Air and Space Chief of Staff, as Commander of San Javier Air Base, home of the Air
          and
          Space Force Academy, receive my warmest welcome to this unique location nearby the Mar Menor.
          Welcome to “Aire-25”, the greatest airshow to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Spanish acrobatic team
          “Patrulla Águila”. An incredible four decades have flown by since a group of courageous fighter pilots created
          this team in 1985 and started to perform airshows all over the world and became Spanish ambassadors painting
          the
          skies with our national flag. During this special weekend it’s time to recognize these heroes and share with
          them a remarkable celebration accompanied with other sister acrobatic teams, many aviators and general public
          from everywhere.<br><br>
          This “Aire-25” airshow has been organized by the Spanish Air and Space Force, as a whole, with the support of
          the surrounding towns of San Javier, San Pedro del Pinatar, Los Alcázares and also with the support of local
          and
          regional authorities, and it will be seen by half a million people around the beaches of Mar Menor. It’s going
          to be a blast!!<br><br>
          Along with this Display Order, we have enclosed all the necessary information and procedures needed to safely
          and efficiently participate in “Aire-25”. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not
          hesitate
          to contact your designated POC.<br><br>
          I look forward to saluting you in person, wishing you a successful and safe Aire-25 airshow and a joyful stay
          in
          this beautiful Murcia region.<br><br>
