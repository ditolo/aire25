        <p id="pwelcome">
          <br><i>Dear colleagues, dear aviators, dear friends:<br><br>
            On behalf of the Spanish Air and Space Chief of Staff, as Commander of San Javier Air Base, home of the Air
            and Space Force Academy, receive my warmest welcome to this unique location nearby the Mar Menor. <br><br>

            Welcome to “Aire-25”, the greatest airshow to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Spanish acrobatic team
            “Patrulla Águila”. An incredible four decades have flown by since a group of courageous fighter pilots
            created
            this team in 1985 and started to perform airshows all over the world and became Spanish ambassadors painting
            the skies with our national flag. During this special weekend it’s time to recognize these heroes and share
            with
            them a remarkable celebration accompanied with other sister acrobatic teams, many aviators and general
            public
            from everywhere.<br><br>

            This “Aire-25” airshow has been organized by the Spanish Air and Space Force, as a whole, with the support
            of
            the surrounding towns of San Javier, San Pedro del Pinatar, Los Alcázares and also with the support of local
            and regional authorities, and it will be seen by half a million people around the beaches of Mar Menor. It’s
            going
            to be a blast!!<br><br>

            Along with this Display Order, we have enclosed all the necessary information and procedures needed to
            safely
            and efficiently participate in “Aire-25”. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not
            hesitate to contact your designated POC.<br><br>

            I look forward to saluting you in person, wishing you a successful and safe Aire-25 airshow and a joyful
            stay
            in this beautiful Murcia region.<br><br>

          - Real Decreto 1919/2009, de 11 de diciembre, por el que se regula la seguridad aeronáutica en las
          demostraciones aéreas civiles. <BR>
          Participants must strictly adhere to such restrictions, with no exceptions, unless national authorities or
          manufactures dictate more restrictive limits.
        </P>
        <h3>Rehearsal</h3>
        <p>A rehearsal prior to the main airshow is mandatory for all flying display participants. <br><br>
          Exceptions will have to be approved by the DD. <br><br>
          Main rehearsal days are Thursday 12th and Friday 13th June.; Sat 14th June rehearsal opportunities for
          exceptional needs will be available upon prior authorization by the DD.
        </p>

        <h3>Time Reference</h3>
        <p>GPS <br>
          ALL TIMES ARE LOCAL (UTC+2)</p>

        <h3>Air Crew Briefing</h3>
        <p>This briefing is mandatory for at least one crewmember per display team (usually commander or flight lead)
          and solo display pilots. <br><br>
          Each pilot attending the briefing will have to sign in. The FCC, in the Main Briefing Room at 08.30LT and
          11.00LT on Friday 13th June and on Sunday 15th, will hold the briefing. Any change or update will be notified
          upon arrival. <br><br>

        <p>In case of changes to the display schedule imposed by unexpected events, the DD will define priorities and
          changes to the program. <br><br>
